## Generic Arcade Game -Udacity Front-End Development Project-3 ##

## Game Description ##

This is a basic arcade game made for the Udacity Google Nanodegree Scholarship Program. 

## How to run this game: ##

1. Clone the game from repo.
2. Load index.html in browser.
3. Play the game.
4. You can also play the game on my GitHub Page (https://kt2187.github.io/udacity-arcade-game/).

## How to play:

Use the arrow keys to move the player. Avoid hitting the bugs while trying to make it to the water on the other side of the grass. If player collides with bug, lose one life and return to starting position. If player reaches the water with at least one life remaining, you win.

## Rules:

* Avoid bug collisions.
* Get to water with at least one life.

## Browser Compatibilities ##

* This application has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## Dependencies: ##

* The project was completed with Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).

## Acknowledgments ##

* Udacity's starter code was used for UI design.
* Udacity Classic Arcade Game Project (Project#3) resource guide.
* Matthew Cranford (incredible student who took the time to create a tutorial with step by step instructions and screenshots).

## Resources I referred to: ##

These resources and webinars were provided by Udacity mentors, coaches, student Leaders, and students. I tried many different approaches to this project and heavily relied on these resources. I would like to add more features to this game but need to move forward in the class.
